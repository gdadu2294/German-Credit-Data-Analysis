German Credit Predictor

Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts whether a credit applicant is likely to have good or bad credit based on the German Credit Dataset. The project aims to assist banks and financial institutions in making informed lending decisions by automating the credit risk assessment process.

German Credit Dataset
The German Credit Dataset used in this project is a widely-used dataset in the field of credit risk assessment. It contains various features related to credit applicants, including age, income, employment status, and more, as well as a binary target variable indicating whether the credit is good (1) or bad (0).

You can find the dataset here.

Model

We have developed a machine learning model to predict whether a credit applicant is likely to have good or bad credit. The model is trained on the German Credit Dataset and uses various classification algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. You can find the code for model training in the Jupyter Notebook.

Evaluation

The performance of the model is evaluated using standard classification metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to distinguish between good and bad credit applicants.

Results

The project's results, including model performance metrics and visualizations, are documented in the Jupyter Notebook. You can also find a summary of the results in the README or a separate Results.md file.
